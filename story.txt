Our group went to Berlin.
We landed at Flughafen airport.
Had our breakfast with Bratwurst.
Then went through Haupstrasse to the market.
We ate too many brot over there and had to leave early.
Rented a Prosche to visit Schloss.
Our Porsche klimaanlage is not working.
Then we got a BMW.
In evening we went to Biergarten.
In dinner we had Boener.
Then I took my hund, Sparky, out for a lovely walk.
